==EVO4 WORDPRESS THEME v.1.0 ===========================
==Released 9/15/2009 under GPL (see LICENSE.txt)========

Evo4 WordPress Theme is based on an irregular 4-column grid that accommodates both "Posts" and "Pages". A Photoshop design template is included to aid in custom design. The grid can be adjusted on the design template, and corresponding adjustments can be made on the stylesheet.

Evo4 is NOT a "plug and play" template for amateur bloggers with no CSS or design skills. It is meant as a framework for professional designers to use in building complete websites with integrated blogs, using WordPress as a CMS. Designers without significant CSS skills, Photoshop skills, and minimal PHP skills will find it difficult to use. Superstars in each of these areas don't need this template. My hope is that designers who are somewhere between these two ends of the designer spectrum will find the theme useful and flexible.

If you wish to see a completed implementation of Evo4, evowebdev.com is built on a beta version of Evo4 theme. Other websites utilizing later versions of the theme will launch soon, and will be identified on EvoBloggito as Evo4 sites.
