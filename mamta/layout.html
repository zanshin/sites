				MAMTA (Manhattan Area Music Teachers Association) is a non-profit organization of professional music educators from Manhattan, KS and the
				surrounding area that strives to advance the value of music study and music-making for our diverse community while supporting the
				professionalism of music teachers and the promotion of a high standard of music teaching among its members.

				MAMTA was established May 20, 1971. MAMTA is affiliated with Music Teachers National Association (MTNA), and Kansas Music Teachers 
				Association (KMTA).

					and activities, this organization will empower its members - teachers with high professional standards - to foster in students a 
					lifelong commitment to music as patrons, performers, teachers, and hobbyists.
