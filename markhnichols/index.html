					</hgroup>
				</header>
				<p>
					In this engagement I had responsibilities spanning project leadership, staff mentoring, object oriented 
					application architecture using UML, and implementation of Rational Unified Process (RUP).  I lead the 
					effort to transition development environment from a proprietary Object Oriented platform (Fort&#233;) to 
					J2EE.  During this project I conducted evaluation of available thin-client frameworks and made the 
					recommendation that resulted in Jakarta Struts framework being selected as the standard for web 
					application development, which resulted in cost and efficiency benefits at client agency.  I developed a 
					Java/HTML prototype using Struts, and developed the necessary interface between the prototype and our 
					legacy Fort&#233; TOOL (Transactional Object Oriented Language) application via MQ Series.  I was assigned 
					to be Project Leader for enterprise-wide object oriented persistence project which had been faltering, and 
					was successful in bringing it back on target, ultimately completing it within its original promised time 
					schedule.  Concurrently I was Project Leader for rules engine based eligibility determination 
					project, using OO architecture and RUP, which was completed 5 months ahead of schedule.  I developed 
					a 60-window “wizard style” user interface for viewing determination results in 8 months utilizing 
					the facade, factory, and chain of responsibility design patterns.
