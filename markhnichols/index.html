Hey! No cheating now... you're supposed to view my resume via the browser not the view source
menu item.  But since you are already here you may as well dig around and see how cunningly
well I crafted this page. All the tags are the same case, they all end properly. White space is
used to improve readability. Where there was a simple way or a complex way to accomplish the
desired effect, the simple way was chosen. 

This document was hand-crafted using TextMate on Mac OS X 10.4.11.
