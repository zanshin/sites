		<h2>Just a Thought</h2>
		<p class="quote">
			&quot;The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires&quot; - William Arthur Ward
		</p>
		<p>
			â€¦ and the best teacher does all of the above. She tells, she explains, she demonstrates, she inspires, and she knows which student needs 
			which at what moment. - Sibylle Kuder

		<h2>Just Another Thought</h2>
		<p>
			During the eighteen months that I was a traveling piano teacher, I discovered an unexpected advantage: I got 
			to see the instrument on which my students practiced (presumably) daily as well as the setup and environment in 
			which they practiced.  Occasionally, a parent would apologetically say, &quot;I am sorry, we only have a - &quot; 
			and then proceed to tell me what they &quot;only&quot; had:  a digital keyboard, an old piano 
			that needs tuning, etc. - followed by, &quot;I don&#39;t know if that is good enough for lessons.&quot;
			<br /><br />
			That&#39;s a curious thought. It begs the question: how can something that&#39;s &quot;not good enough&quot; 
			for teaching be possibly good enough for practicing?
			<br /><br />
			Think about it:  when students come to the teacher&#39;s studio for their lesson, once a week for 30 to 60 minutes, 
			they get to play and study and try new things and correct old things on the (hopefully good) instrument their 
			teacher has.  Then they go home and practice, (presumably) every day for 30 to 60 minutes or longer, on their 
			instrument.  That&#39;s a ratio of at least 1 to 6.  If you are afraid your instrument at home is not good enough 
			for lessons - that makes it one &quot;good&quot; instrument to six or more inferior instruments.  How can 
			you possibly expect to make progress like that? 
			<br /><br />
			Imagine, pretend, that you are taking lessons to learn how to color with coloring pencils.  Your teacher has 
			a nice assortment of nicely sharp pencils.  The lesson goes well, you are motivated to practice at home.  Only 
			your collection of pencils at home has quite a few colors missing, and some of the rest are broken.  Or, you only 
			have crayons to practice with. 
			<br /><br />
			If you want to learn how to color with coloring pencils, you need a good assortment of sharp coloring pencils at 
			home.  If you want to learn how to play the piano, you need a good piano at home.  Simple, isn&#39;t it?
