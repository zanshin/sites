		<h2>How to Get Started</h2>
		<p>
			While the monthly <a href="http://sibyllekuder.com/tuition.php" title="Tuition" target="_blank">tuition</a> is based on the number 
			of lessons in a semester, new students can start at any time. Call or email to set up a first meeting where we can 
			discuss your musical goals, discover a little bit about each other, and decide if this is a good fit for
			every one. Parents, this initial session gives you and your child a chance to see how they react to me and my
			teaching style.  The first meeting usually lasts twenty to thirty minutes and is free of charge.
		</p>
		<p>
			All students must have a good instrument at home for practice. The best instrument is a good quality, well 
			maintained grand piano. However, space restrictions and cost often make this less of an option. A good quality 
			studio upright (approximately 44 to 48 inches tall) or a good quality console (approximately 40 to 43 inches 
			tall) would make an excellent instrument. These instruments have strings long enough to 
			produce a rich, full sound. Studio uprights many times have longer strings than "baby" grand pianos and 
			consequently a better sound and playing experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is possible to purchase a good digital piano that has weighted keys; however, money invested in a gently used
			upright would be better spent. I am happy to accompany any student to area piano stores to help with the selection
			of an instrument. The <a href="http://www.bluebookofpianos.com/types.htm" title="Blue Book of Pianos"target="_blank">Blue Book 
			of Pianos</a> website is an excellent online soure of information about the different styles of pianos for 
			those wanting to do some research.

		<h2>Just a Thought</h2>
		<p class="quote">
			&quot;The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires&quot; - William Arthur Ward
		</p>
		<p>
			… and the best teacher does all of the above. She tells, she explains, she demonstrates, she inspires, and she knows which student needs 
			which at what moment. - Sibylle Kuder
		</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Just Another Thought</h2>
		<p>
			During the eighteen months that I was a traveling piano teacher, I discovered an unexpected advantage: I got 
			to see the instrument on which my students practiced (presumably) daily as well as the setup and environment in 
			which they practiced.  Occasionally, a parent would apologetically say, &quot;I am sorry, we only have a - &quot; 
			and then proceed to tell me what they &quot;only&quot; had:  a digital keyboard, an old piano 
			that needs tuning, etc. - followed by, &quot;I don&#39;t know if that is good enough for lessons.&quot;
			<br /><br />
			That&#39;s a curious thought. It begs the question: how can something that&#39;s &quot;not good enough&quot; 
			for teaching be possibly good enough for practicing?
			<br /><br />
			Think about it:  when students come to the teacher&#39;s studio for their lesson, once a week for 30 to 60 minutes, 
			they get to play and study and try new things and correct old things on the (hopefully good) instrument their 
			teacher has.  Then they go home and practice, (presumably) every day for 30 to 60 minutes or longer, on their 
			instrument.  That&#39;s a ratio of at least 1 to 6.  If you are afraid your instrument at home is not good enough 
			for lessons - that makes it one &quot;good&quot; instrument to six or more inferior instruments.  How can 
			you possibly expect to make progress like that? 
			<br /><br />
			Imagine, pretend, that you are taking lessons to learn how to color with coloring pencils.  Your teacher has 
			a nice assortment of nicely sharp pencils.  The lesson goes well, you are motivated to practice at home.  Only 
			your collection of pencils at home has quite a few colors missing, and some of the rest are broken.  Or, you only 
			have crayons to practice with. 
			<br /><br />
			If you want to learn how to color with coloring pencils, you need a good assortment of sharp coloring pencils at 
			home.  If you want to learn how to play the piano, you need a good piano at home.  Simple, isn&#39;t it?
