			Summer tuition is all-inclusive; students are guaranteed eight lessons but are encouraged 
			to attend as many lessons and classes as they wish and scheduling permits. 
			This year's program includes:
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
			Eight 30-minute private<sup>*</sup> piano lessons in your home, to be scheduled at your and
			my convenience - there is much flexibility in the summer: lesson days and times
			can change if necessary (and possible), lessons don't always have to happen on the
			same weekday or at the same time.  I look forward to working around your 
			vacation schedule!  <br /><sup>*</sup> Private means one-on-one. If appropriate, six 45-minute lessons 
			may be substituted for eight 30-minute lessons.
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
			Additional lessons are offered in my home at no additional charge, to be scheduled
			at my convenience.
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
			Group events!  This year's focus is on the Russian composer Prokofiev. Some of the
			planned events are: <i>Peter and the Wolf</i> (introduction to the instruments of
			the orchestra, learning to play some of the tunes on the pinao, both by ear and
			from the score, etc.)  <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and/or <i>Cinderella</i> (
			introduction to ballet, listening to Prokofiev's arrangements of some of the
			ballet).  Prokofiev's life, his piano music, and, for advanced students, his 
			orchestral music (Classical Symphony, Piano Concertos, Violin Concertos).
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
			Performance classes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Summer tuition: $210 - covers all of the above.  Tuition is due June 1st.
