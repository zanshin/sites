			My name is Sibylle Kuder. I was born and raised in Germany. From age 12 until about 19,
			I studied piano with the Hungarian pianist Barbara Fry at the Winnender
			Jugendmusikschule. Our piano class benefitted from collaborations with composers,
			chamber musicians, and her husband, Thomas Ungar, professor of conducting at the
			Stuttgarter Staatliche Musikhochschule. Frau Professor Fry recently retired from the
			Heidelberg Staatliche Musikhochschule where she was professor of piano and pedagogy.
			After Hungarian pianist and composer Andras Hamary prepared me for the college entrance
			exam I was accepted at the Trossingen Staatliche Musikhochschule where I studied Piano
			Performance and Pedagogy. While still in Germany, I was fortunate enough to be able to
			attend masterclasses with such eminent musicians as Bruno Seidlhofer
			(Interpretation masterclass), Vienna; Elza Kolodin (Chopin masterclass) and
			Edith Picht-Axenfeld (Bach masterclass), Freiburg/Breisgau.
		</p>
		<p>
			After moving to the United States, I attended the Graduate Program (Piano Performance
			and Pedagogy) at Kansas State University, studying piano performance with Robert Edwards,
			and piano pedagogy with Virginia Houser.  After winning the 1995 Concerto Competion, I was 
			given the honor of performing with the Kansas State University orchestra in McCain auditorum. I
			continue to attend numerous master classes, workshops, conferences and conventions.
			Additionally, my interest in Early Childhood Music and Movement led me to study with
			Jill Citro Hannagan in Chicago. I am certified to teach "Family Music" and "The Cycle of
			Seasons," both of which are early childhood music and movement education programs of the
			<a href="http://musikgarten.org" title="Musikgarten" target="_blank">Musikgarten</a> Curriculum.
		</p>
			Currently, I am a member of the:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Music Teachers National Association (MTNA),</li>
			<li>Kansas Music Teacher Association (KMTA),</li>
			<li>Kansas City Music Teachers Association (KCMTA),</li>
			<li>Manhattan Area Music Teacher Association (MAMTA).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For many years, I have been involved in the MAMTA-sponsored Music Fair and Concerto
			Competition (chairperson) and KMTA District and State Honors Auditions, as well as
			Music Progressions (chairperson, adjudicator). Currently I am president of the Manhattan
			Area Music Teachers Association (MAMTA).
		<p>
		<p>
			I have over the past 20 years taught all ages and levels, including pre-piano
			classes for which I designed the materials myself, and non-major piano
			classes in the Music Department at Kansas State University, in addition to private
			and group lessons for school-aged children and for adults.
		</p>
		<p>
			From August 1995 until May 2007, I owned a private piano studio in Manhattan with about
			20 - 30 students between the ages of 4 and 25.  By the end of May 2007, half of these students
			had been with me since they first started lessons, some for over nine years.
		</p>
		<p>
			Between May 2007 and December 2008 I lived and taught in Overland Park and Olathe Kansas. During 
			that time I travelled to students&#8217; homes in the Kansas City area as well as in Manhattan. In
			January 2009, I returned to Manhattan full-time, and re-opened my studio here.

		<p>
			I have consistently been able to provide dedicated students with the preparation
			necessary to compete successfully at local and state competitions and auditions,
			among them the Baldwin Piano Competition in Overland Park, the Manhattan Area Music
			Teachers Annual Piano Concerto Competition, the KCMTA-sponsored Concerto
			Recital in Kansas City, and the Konza Opus 8 Composition Festival in Manhattan.
		</p>
		<p>
			I enjoy teaching all ages and levels, but I do require substantial parental involvement
			until students are at least 10 years old; even parents of older students are <i>always</i>
			welcome to sit in on lessons.  Particular attention is given to a natural and injury-free
			technique and to thorough mastery of all studied materials.
