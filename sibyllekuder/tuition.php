		<h1>A Word About Tuition</h1>
		<p>
			What you pay is tuition.  It is  not an hourly fee for services rendered
			(like baby-sitting) because teaching is much more than the time one spends
			with a student.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's a brief overview of what your tuition pays for:
		</p>

		<p>
			The <strong>obvious</strong>: "contact hours" - that is, the piano lesson, private or group;
			preparation and evaluation of lesson plans, materials, etcetera. Bookkeeping
			and organizing: lesson scheduling, recital planning and scheduling,
			organizing and preparing students for performances and seasonal activities.
		</p>

		<p>
			The <strong>no-so-obvious</strong>: review of new materials, software programs, audio CDs,
			videos, et cetera, which the students might use. In teaching, one size does
			<i>not</i> fit all; I am always looking for "the perfect piece" or whether
			a newly published book might be of value to a particular student.  Long-term
			planning for my students: Where do we want to be in six months? In one year?
			How will we get there? What are the possible road blocks that need to be
			addressed?  And so on.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Additionally</strong>, review and evaluation of my materials, such as books on
			teaching, professional journals (notably <i>American Music Teacher</i>,
			<i>Clavier</i>, <i>Keyboard Companion</i>, etcetera). I believe that
			my special interest in and search for materials with relevance to
			Special Education, Early Childhood Music and Movement, brain research
			and music therapy, benefits all my students.

		<h1>Tuition</h1>
		<h2>Fall 2009</h2>
		<p>
			August 18 - December 19 
		</p>
		<p>
			Lesson format:
		</p>
		<p>
			Young students, beginners, and most transfer students<sup>*</sup> receive two 30-minutes lessons 
			per week, preferably Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. As with martial arts, gymnastics and 
			other extra-curricular activities, this more frequent student-teacher contact and interaction 
			reinforces the fundamental skills and practice techniques necessary for a successful, and 
			enjoyable, piano experience. Twice weekly lessons also reduce the potential for incorrect 
			practicing in between lessons, thus allowing us to focus more time on learning and less time 
			on correcting inadvertent mistakes or having to re-learn last week’s concept. I am always more 
			than willing to re-teach something if the student doesn’t understand the concept, but it is a waste 
			of time to have to re-teach simply because too much time has elapsed since the last time we 
			explored the new concept.
		</p>
		<p>
			The goal is not to progress faster - though it is a welcome side effect - but to provide more 
			frequent feedback, the way it happens in school: no one would think of sending a child to 
			school once a week for 30 minutes, cram a lot of new information in, and then leave the child 
			alone for an entire week. It is usually not until 6th grade that school children ever have to 
			deal with a project the deadline of which is more than a few days away.
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
			<sup>*</sup>Until they are in 4th grade, I consider my students "young". A "beginner" is someone 
			who has not yet finished the equivalent of Level 2B (the orange book) of the Piano Adventure 
			series by Faber&Faber. "Finish the book" means having mastered all of the concepts and being able 
			to play most of the pieces in the book along with the CD. Because of the different approach 
			each teacher has, most transfer students benefit from the more frequent student-teacher 
			interaction as well.
			</p>
			<p>
			Once students are reliably independent in their practicing and play longer pieces 
			which necessitate longer lessons, we switch to once-a-week 45 minute lessons.
			</p>
			<p>
			I do not offer once-a-week 30-minute lessons.
			</p>
			<p>
			Monthly tuition: $100
			</p>
			<p>
			Tuition is due on the first of the month. August tuition is 50% (still due on the first of the
			month) since the studio is open only the last two weeks of the month.
			</p>
			<p>
			Individual lessons are available upon request and will be billed at $40 per hour.
			</p>
			<p>
			Time and scheduling permitting, there will be group and performance classes offered at no 
			additional cost. I will try to schedule group events at everyone's convenience.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h2>For All Students</h2>
		<p>
			Included in the tuition are private piano instruction and group events, as well as recital
			fees.  Not included are materials, books, and audition fees.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are opportunities to make up missed lessons. <i>No refund will be given for
			missed lessons.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			In case of catastrophic illness or a family tragedy, the Semester tuition will be prorated
			and refunded.  A broken arm, wrist, or hand, though traumatic, is a splendid opportunity
			to focus on the other arm and still make beautiful progress.  The criterion is: if the broken
			arm, wrist, or hand allows you to attend school or work, then you are well enough to
			attend piano lessons.  Once in twenty years, I had a student who managed to break
			<i>both</i> arms.  She did take a break from piano lessons, as well as many other
			things for a while...
